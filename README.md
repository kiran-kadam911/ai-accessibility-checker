# ♿ AI Accessibility Checker
A smart Python CLI tool to scan your project’s frontend code for WCAG compliance issues using OpenAI AI analysis.

## Features
- Supports WCAG Levels: A, AA, AAA
- Supports WCAG Versions: 2.0, 2.1, 2.2
- Skips unnecessary folders (node_modules, .git, __pycache__, etc.)
- AI-powered suggestions for each detected issue
- Output in table or list format
- Works as standalone CLI or pre-commit hook

## Detects accessibility problems like:
- ✅ Missing alt attributes
- 🎨 Low contrast text
- ⌨️ Keyboard navigation issues
- 📜 Improper semantic markup
- 🖼️ ARIA misusage
- 🧠 AI-powered suggestions to fix detected issues

## 🧠 How It Works

- Reads files and adds line numbers
- Sends file contents to OpenAI with WCAG context
- AI detects violations and returns JSON
- Script formats and displays results

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
Before using this tool, make sure you have the following installed:
1. **Python 3.9+**
    
    Mac: 

    Python 3 is usually preinstalled. Check with:

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

    If missing, install via Python.org or Homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew install python
    ```

    Windows:

    Download from Python.org
    When installing, make sure to check the box "Add Python to PATH".
    Verify:

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

    Linux:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
    ```

2. **Pip (Python package manager)**

   ```bash
    pip --version
    ```

    If missing:
    ```bash
    python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
    ```

3. **Virtual Environment (recommended)**

    This avoids dependency conflicts.

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
    ```

## 📦 Installation

1️⃣ Clone / Copy this script into your project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiran-kadam911/ai-accessibility-checker.git
cd ai-accessibility-checker
```

2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

📄 requirements.txt

```bash
python-dotenv
tabulate
openai>=1.0.0
```

## 🔐 Setup OpenAI API Key
You can get your key from [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). (for AI suggestions)

To use AI-powered features, you need to provide your OpenAI API key.
    
    bash -c 'read -p "Enter your OpenAI API Key: " key && echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=$key" > .env'

This will generate a .env file in your project root like:

    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxx

## 🚀 Usage

### Standalone CLI
Run

```bash
python ai_accessibility_checker.py
```

You will be prompted to:

```bash
👋 Welcome to AI Accessibility Checker

🧩 Which WCAG accessibility level do you want to check? (A / AA / AAA):
📘 Which WCAG version do you want to check? (2.0 / 2.1 / 2.2): 
📊 How would you like results? (table / list): 
📂 Enter the directory path to scan the files (leave blank for current directory): 
```

**Example Output (Table)**
| #  | Issue Title           | Type      | Severity | Line(s)      | Description | Suggestion |
|----|-----------------------|-----------|----------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1  | Low contrast for text | Contrast  | High     | 25, 29, 231, 233 | Text has low contrast due to faint opacity, making it hard for visually impaired users. | Increase opacity to ≥0.5 to meet contrast ratio requirements. |

**Example Output (List)**

**Missing Alt Text on Image** [Alt Text] _(Severity: High)_
   - **Lines:** 15  
   - **Description:** `<img>` lacks `alt` attribute for screen readers.  
   - **Suggestion:** Add descriptive `alt` text to all `<img>` elements.

### ⚙️ checker.config.json

The checker.config.json file allows you to customize how the AI Accessibility Checker scans your project.

**Configuration options:**
- **SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS** – List of file types the checker will scan (e.g., .html, .twig, .css, .jsx).
- **EXCLUDED_DIRS** – Directories to skip during scanning (e.g., node_modules, build, .git).
- **EXCLUDED_PATTERNS** – File name patterns to ignore (e.g., Storybook files like .stories.jsx).
- **MODEL** – Defines which AI model to use for accessibility analysis.

This configuration helps tailor the scan to your project’s structure, ensuring that only relevant files are checked while ignoring unnecessary or temporary files.
